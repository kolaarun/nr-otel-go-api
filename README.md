# GO CRUD Rest API using Mux, Postgres, Docker, and Docker Compose

### I have created a GO CRUD Rest API which keeps account of Mens 100m Race using,

- Mux (Framework to build web servers in Go)

- Postgres (relational database)

- Docker (for containerization)

- Docker Compose

### I have created 5 endpoints for basic CRUD operations,

- Create

- Read all

- Read one

- Update

- Delete

### Here are the steps I went through:

- Create a Go application using Mux as a framework

- Dockerize the Go application writing a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml file to run the application and the database.

- Run the Postgres database in a container using Docker Compose, and test it with TablePlus.

- Build the Go App image and run it in a container using Docker Compose, then test it with Postman.

#### With this our GO CRUD Rest API using Mux, Postgres, Docker, and Docker Compose has been created
